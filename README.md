You can think of "Track" in anyway you like. Movies you own, movies you want to see, your top 100, etc... 
There are few things I would like to see. 

Your App should [...] use information from and make calls to a 3rd party API (one below). 
Finally, your App should be versioned and submitted using GIT (GitHub, BitBucket, Beanstalk). 

Movie Data:
[...] Get your movie info from https://www.themoviedb.org/ using their API at http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/
